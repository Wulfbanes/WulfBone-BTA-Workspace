Blaze - need for speed

[[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]] asks to see you after mess one evening.

"Commander, I've got an interesting proposal for you. You know I've always loved going fast, and before I enlisted in the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreMAF],MAF]] I was a hell of an off-road endurance racer. We travel all over the Inner Sphere but spend half the time sitting in orbit doing nothing. I want to race again, but I need startup funding and someone to call strategy for me. That's where you come in. You call races for me, and we split the cost <i>and</i> the winnings 50-50. I even tracked down two vehicles that should work, and they both cost about the same. First is a classic for a reason, the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[TBoneLoreApocalypseWR],Apocalypse World Rover]], built by [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreGM],GM]]. The second is a newer design by [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreEarthwerksInc],Earthwerks]], the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[TBoneLoreIBexRV],Ibex RV]].\r\n\n\nWaddya say?"


1.	Apocalypse World Rover [100k]

"Yeah, why not? I'm a sucker for the classics, [[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]]. Let's get the Apocalypse World Rover."

"Awesome! The [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[TBoneLoreApocalypseWR],Apocalypse]] isn't the fastest or nimblest off-roader, but you can't beat it for plain durability or fuel capacity. You won't regret this, Commander {Commander.LastName}. With you running strategy and me driving, I think we can makes some real money. Plus, I bet a lot of the crew will get a kick out of watching!"

2.	Ibex RV [100k]

"Sure [[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]], let's give it a shot. I like the look of that Ibex RV."

"Yes! The [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[TBoneLoreIBexRV],Ibex]] was made for this kind of thing. It's faster than the Apocalypse, and nimble as a cat. The only real downsides are the smaller fuel tank and the lower-grade armor plating. I think we've got a real chance at making some good money with this, and I bet the crew will love watching too! With me driving and you on stratcom, we'll be unbeatable.
