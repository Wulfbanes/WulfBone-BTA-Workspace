Blaze - need for speed

[[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]] asks to see you after mess one evening.\r\n\n
\"Commander, I've got an interesting proposal for you. You know I've always loved going fast, and before I enlisted in the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreMAF],MAF]] I was a hell of an off-road endurance racer. We travel all over the Inner Sphere but spend half the time sitting in orbit doing nothing. I want to race again, but I need startup funding and someone to call strategy for me. That's where you come in. You call races for me, and we split the cost <i>and</i> the winnings 50-50. I even tracked down two vehicles that should work, and they both cost about the same. First is a classic for a reason, the Apocalypse World Rover, built by [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreGM],GM]]. The second is a newer design by [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreEarthwerksInc],Earthwerks]], the Ibex RV.\r\n\n\nWaddya say?



Apocalypse World Rover - top speed 65 kph, 1600km range, BAR7 armor, 6 wheels
Ibex RV - top speed 80kph, 500km range, BAR4 armor, 4 wheels - potentially better offroad
