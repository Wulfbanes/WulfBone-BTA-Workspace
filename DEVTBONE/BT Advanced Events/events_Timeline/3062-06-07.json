        "Details": "BLACK MAY DEATH TOLL LOWER THAN EXPECTED\r\n\n\nSian, [[DM.Factions[faction_Liao],Capellan Confederation]]: Officials from both the [[DM.Factions[faction_Liao],Capellan Confederation]] and the [[DM.Factions[faction_Ives],St. Ives Compact]] have  released simultaneous statements confirming the capture of the last [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreThuggee],Thuggee]] terrorists implicated in the Black May nerve gas attacks. Total casualties of the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreThuggee],Thuggee]] attacks are reported to be in the vicinity of 10000, a far cry from the nearly 5 million casualties initially estimated. Although Capellan authorities publicly cooperated with their [[DM.Factions[faction_Ives],St. Ives Compact]] counterparts in apprehending the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreThuggee],Thuggee]] terrorists and halting the attacks, some within the Compact have accused the Capellans of dragging their feet and tacitly allowing the Black May attacks to proceed. The fact that [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreThuggee],Thuggee]] terrorists apprehended by the Capellans simply disappear into [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreMaskirovka],Maskirovka]] custody rather than being publicly tried further fuels these accusations.\r\n\n\nPlease stay tuned for a word from our sponsor.",
