Although most traditionally Lyran worlds have continued to support [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreKatherineSteiner],Katherine Steiner]], there have been exceptions. The latest of these is the mineral-rich world of Thorin, where the planetary militia led by [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreStarLeague2],Star League]] Medal of Honor winner [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreArcherChristifori],Archer Christifori]] has fought a long guerilla campaign against the 15th Arcturan Guards assigned to keep the system under Steiner control. The militia forces succeeded in ambushing and defeating the occupying force led by Col. Felix Blucher, securing both Thorin and nearby Muphrid for [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreVictorSD],Victor Steiner-Davion]].",

Units equipped with this armor appear to be able shrug off a much greater amount of artillery fire than expected, although some units have been observed sustaining sudden catastrophic explosions when under fire. Initial observations suggest the armor may be based on an ancient, pre-Hegemony principle only now successfully scaled up for modern BattleMechs.",
