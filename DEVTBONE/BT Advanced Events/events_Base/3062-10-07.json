Negotiations laying the groundwork for the nonaggression pact had been ongoing since the late 3050’s, and both Taurian and Canopian forces have seen action in the ongoing Capellan-St. Ives conflict. With the three realms drawing closer together, they form a powerful voting bloc within the reformed [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreStarLeague2],Star League]]. Nonetheless, canny mercenary companies will likely be able to find those in need of help with off-the-books contracts, as garrison commanders in all three signatory states scramble for last-minute territory and prestige.\r\n\n\n\nST. IVES FALLS TO [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreLiaoCCAF],CCAF]]!\r\n\n\n After months of brutal fighting, forces of the [[DM.Factions[faction_Liao],Capellan Confederation]] Armed Forces and their allies reached the capital city of Tian-tan. Although Duchess Candace Liao was able to escape the planet before being captured, most observers agree that the Capellan victory here should quickly spell the end of the [[DM.Factions[faction_Ives],St. Ives Compact]] as a viable fighting force.\r\n\n\nPlease stay tuned for a word from our sponsor.",
