On Dustball, the Seventh Falcon Regulars and the Jade Falcon Eyrie Cluster landed, quickly inflicting heavy casualties on the local militia brigade. Meanwhile on Koniz, the mercenary [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreBarbersM2s],Barber’s Marauder IIs]] were utterly demolished by nothing more than a mixed force of [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreElementals],Elementals]] and the 124th Striker Cluster. Scattered reports from the area indicate that the Marauder IIs were hunted down to a man, with the survivors taken as [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreIsorla],<i>isorla</i>]]. Although the full extent of the Jade Falcon incursion is currently unknown, additional reports of Jade Falcon units engaging Lyran forces continue to trickle in.\r\n\n\nWould you like to know more?",
