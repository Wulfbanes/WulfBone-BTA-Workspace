Fortunately for [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreVictorSD],Victor Steiner-Davion]], this was not to be. Covert elements of the First Davion Guards apparently conducted a widespread campaign of sabotage throughout New Avalon. With viruses and other attacks spreading throughout the entire Steiner military command and control network, the military capabilities of Loyalist forces on New Avalon have been significantly degraded for the time-being. In addition, debilitating attacks were carried out at the facilities of [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreCoreanEnt],Corean Enterprises]], [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreAchernarBM],Achernar BattleMechs]], and [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreLDIntroTech],Lycomb-Davion IntroTech]], drastically reducing New Avalon’s production capacity.",

Neither side having a clear objective to the conflict, they quickly settled on a [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreTrialPoss],Trial of Possession]] for the Combine world of Courchevel, with the Dominion agreeing to return any and all worlds captured during the conflict regardless of the outcome. Such a Trial would allow both parties to end their conflict without losing honor, and turn to deal with their new, more serious threats. Although [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreKuritaDCMS],DCMS]] units fought bravely, in the end the Dominion forces prevailed.",
