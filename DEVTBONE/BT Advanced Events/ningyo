req Ningyo injured

Following the last deployment, [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[TBoneLoreDoc],Doc Cobble]] and [[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]] calls you to the MedBay, where you find her laying on an exam table, him looking over a chart.

Doc looks up from her chart, "Commander, you know we give pilots a full workup after taking  hits in the field. Well I found a tumor in {SCN_MW.Callsign}'s brain...and I think it may be what's been causing her to get sick when wearing the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[TBoneLoreNeurohelmet],neurohelmet]]. It's benign, so it won't kill her, but she'll continue to get dizzy and sick on drops."

{SCN_MW.Callsign} chimes in, "Doc says I have a few options, and they're all surgery...but I'm scared. I've been reading about these rare silicon dioxide crystals that are supposed to be able to shrink tumors on their own, but they're kind of expensive. What do you think?"

You consider a moment before replying "Doc, what kind of surgery we talking about here? Is this crystal option real?"

"Well...it's brain surgery, Commander. It's not minor...she'll be feeling the after-effects for a while, but the better our facilities are, the faster her recovery will be. As for the crystals, <i>could</i> they work? Sure. Just like our XO <i>could</i> learn to read a map. I really can't recommend any remedies based on so-called "lapidary medicine"...there's never been <i>any</i> evidence they work better than a placebo."



[Option1, expensive surgery, req medbay 2nd upgrade, cost 100k]
"Let's do the surgery, and let's do it right."

//		Several hours later, [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[TBoneLoreDoc],Doc]] calls you back to the MedBay. To your surprise, you see [[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]] sitting up in bed, chatting with Doc as you walk in.

"I take it the surgery went well then?"

"Doc says I should be back in the cockpit within a week. I might be off my game for a little while, but he's pretty sure I won't have any nausea after that!"

"That's great to hear {SCN_MW.Callsign}. Doc, excellent work as always."

[piloting -1 30 days, piloting +1]


[Option , cheap surgery. No reqs.]
"Doc, do what you can with what we have on hand."

//		Several hours later, [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[TBoneLoreDoc],Doc]] calls you back to the MedBay, where you see [[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]] asleep up in bed, IV lines in both arms.

"Doc, what's the verdict? How'd the surgery go?"

"There were a few complications, but she's out of the woods now and the I was able to remove the tumor entirely. I'll wake her up in the next few days and we'll go from there, but my guess is she'll be out of commission for a month, and won't be at 100% for some time after."

"Alright, keep me posted."

[option healing crystals, req 250k]

"Let's give the healing crystals a shot while you're recovering."

"Great Commander! I'll order them right away!"

Doc shakes his head and grumbles to himself "Why do I even bother when suddenly everyone else is damn expert on everything..."
