this ones a doozy.

tbone_event_co_MaxRevenge1 requires commander uninjured and spent 23000XP, one other MW uninjured, and Max injured. And also need to be in wolf space.

If you choose to support Max (basically fight for him bc he's injured), you can make him call his mother or not. That decides his outcome if you win the duel.
If you choose to support Max and lose the duel, Max gets low morale but that's it.
tbone_event_co_MaxRevenge2 is the post-mission, forced from the contract. 0 weight, and a required company tag "do_not_fire"

If you choose to support Max, but actually abandon the contract (or take >15 days to do it), he'll leave you and die.
		tbone_event_co_MaxRevenge2a is a regular event (high weight), exclusion tag: max_revenge_cooldown, and requires max_revenge 1-2 as below

		1-2 means contract accepted (required for abandonment above).
		3-4 means contract attempted but failed,
