    "Details" : "After the Jade Falcon incursion of 3058, Inner Sphere leaders met on Tharkad to draft a new Star League Constitution and appoint a new First Lord, the first in the many centuries since the end of the original Star League. The new Star League Constitution was built largely on the framework of the original, with the important exception of the role of First Lord. While the original First Lords were all members of House Cameron, the new position would be held on a rotating basis, with the leader of each member nation serving a three-year term and unable to serve again until every other nation's leader had already served.",
