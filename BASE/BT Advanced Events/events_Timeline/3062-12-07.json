The execution came following months of unrest on Kentares IV precipitated by the arrival of a command of the Fifth Donegal Guards under the command of Steiner loyalist Marcus Roland. With the death of Dresari and the populace under the firm control of Steiner forces, many experts predict Kentares IV will soon be just one of many flashpoints in the growing schism between the Steiner and Davion halves of the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreFedCom],Federated Commonwealth]].",

Vocally opposed to [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreKatherineSteiner],Katherine Steiner]]'s rule, Hasek has likewise refused to endorse or directly support [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreVictorSD],Victor Steiner-Davion]], preferring to focus his forces on the threat of the [[DM.Factions[faction_Liao],Capellan Confederation]]. Nonetheless, the defeat of the Lyran 8th RCT serves as a sharp rebuke to Steiner ambitions in the area, and most observers are keenly watching to see whether the Kathil Shipyards' <i>Avalon</i>-class WarShips will go to the Lyrans or the [[DM.Factions[faction_Davion],FedSuns]].
