What began as a Grand Championship match between Steiner favorite Michael Searcy and Davion star Victor Vandergriff turned into open warfare after a failure of the Solaris stadium containment field allowed the two fighters to break through the stadium walls and into the streets. Fans and nationals on both sides quickly took to arms, dividing the city into Lyran and [[DM.Factions[faction_Davion],FedSuns]] districts. Only after the two champions met to finish their duel did the fighting within the city die down, though it has yet to subside completely.\r\n\n\n\n[[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreMRBC],MRBC]] TO REOPEN OFFICE ON GALATEA, NEW OFFICES PLANNED\r\n\n\n[[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreOutreach],Outreach]]: The [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreMRBC],Mercenary Review and Bonding Commission]] has announced the acquisition and reopening of the troubled Galatea mercenary hall following years of neglect. The Galatea facility has long had a reputation as a haven for mercenary commands with a less-than-stellar [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreMRBC],MRBC]] rating, with rumors of illegal contracts and pirate contact becoming commonplace. In addition, the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreMRBC],MRBC]] has revealed plans to open additional satellite offices on [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreSolaris7],Solaris VII]], Arc-Royal, and Northwind in order to “better facilitate contract arbitration, unit evaluation, and customer satisfaction.”\r\n\n\nPlease stay tuned for a word from our sponsor.",
