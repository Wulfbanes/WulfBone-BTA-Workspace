Sources close to the chancellor claim that \"cultural differences\" and \"political expediency\" are behind the decision. No other details have been forthcoming, but several detachments of the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreLiaoCCAF],CCAF]] along the border of the [[DM.Factions[faction_Marik],Free Worlds League]] are reportedly being maintained in a heightened state of readiness.\r\n\n\n\nNERVE AGENTS USED IN ST. IVES CONFLICT!\r\n\n\nSt. Ives, [[DM.Factions[faction_Ives],St. Ives Compact]]: In what is becoming known as the Black May attacks, a series of nerve  gas attacks by rogue elements of the [[DM.Factions[faction_Liao],Capellan Confederation]] has left the leadership of the [[DM.Factions[faction_Ives],St. Ives Compact]] reeling but unbroken. Sources within both the Compact and the Confederation indicate that the attacks are being carried out by a splinter sect of \"[[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreThuggee],Thuggee]] cultists\" loyal to Kali Liao, sister of Capellan Chancellor [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreSunTzuLiao],Sun-Tzu Liao]]. These same sources indicate that Kali Liao has since been remanded into the custody of the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreStarLeague2],Star League]] Council to stand before a war crimes tribunal in Atreus. Retaliatory nerve attacks are likely to continue.\r\n\n\nWould you like to know more?",

The same spokesperson was authorized to confirm that enhanced interrogation of captured [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreThuggee],Thuggee]] terrorists suggests that up to fifteen canisters of nerve agent are yet unaccounted for, with the potential to cause over 5 million casualties. Although the specific formulation of the nerve agent has not been released, previous conflicts on Wei had resulted in the release of a [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreStarLeague2],Star League]]-era agent designated UrbStryc-A, and mercenary commands deploying to either the vicinity of Wei or the [[DM.Factions[faction_Ives],St. Ives Compact]] are encouraged to take all necessary precautions, including preparation of [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreCBRN],CBRN-MOPP]] and DeCon gear where applicable.",
