IVES COMPACT SURRENDERS, JOINS CAPELLAN CONFEDERATION!\r\n\n\nSian, Capellan Confederation: After the fall of St. Ives last September, members of the Compact leadership reached out to the Confederation leadership to begin the process of negotiating an end to the conflict. Following a series of ceasefires beginning in January, negotiations between the Allard-Liao noble family and the Capellan leadership finally brought an end to the bloody conflict early last month. Although many of the specifics of the truce are not being made public at this time, the Allard-Liao family is rumored to be preserved as the hereditary rulers of the new St. Ives Commonality. A joint Star League-ComStar peacekeeping force is to be deployed to ensure the terms of the truce are honored by both sides.\r\n\n\nPlease stay tuned for a word from our sponsor.",
