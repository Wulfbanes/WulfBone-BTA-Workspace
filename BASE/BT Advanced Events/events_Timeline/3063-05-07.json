Marik’s mercenary unit, Kristen’s Krushers had originally been contracted by the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreLyranAlliance],Lyran Alliance]] under the command of the Alliance Jaegers on Coventry. When the death of [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreArthurSteinerDavion],Arthur Steiner-Davion]] ignited the conflict between the Coventry Provincial Militia and the Jaegers, the Krushers were ordered to assault the Coventry Militia Academy. Perhaps seeking an excuse to void the Krushers’ contract and pocket the payment, the Jaegers commander Jason Walker turned on the Krushers following the battle, citing “complicity with traitors” as the reason. With the Jaegers now hostile, Mark led her forces off-planet, beginning a series of raids against Lyran holdings throughout the region. Unfortunately for Marik and the Krushers, the <i>LAS Yggrasil</i> and the 2nd Donegal Guards were waiting in Arcadia and after weeks of desperate combat, Marik fell in battle against her former employers.",

                        "Details": "MERCMANS MECH REVIEWS: ARGUS\r\n\n\nThe new Argus BattleMech debuted by the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreFedCom],Federated Commonwealth]] last year has quickly become a hit on both sides of the FedCom civil war, and for good reason. The Argus hauls its 60-ton bulk across the battlefield with the agility of a smaller mech, while an endo-steel chassis and XL engine save weight for ample armor and weaponry. In addition, the Argus boasts a Beagle Active Probe to assist in target acquisition and an anything-goes load-out that compares favorably with some assault mechs. With all that expensive tech and equipment, you might expect the Argus to be a hangar queen, but you’d be wrong. Originally designed as an easy-to-repair OmniMech, the Argus is proving to be very popular with mechtechs. All told, the Argus is a solid addition to Steiner and Davion forces and avoids the long-standing 60-tonner problem of being considered “a heavy medium.” Enterprising mercenary commands would do well to keep an eye out and pick up an Argus should the opportunity arise. Just don’t fall down.",
