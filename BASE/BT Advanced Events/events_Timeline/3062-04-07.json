IVES CONFLICT\r\n\n\nSt. Ives, [[DM.Factions[faction_Ives],St. Ives Compact]]: Confounding all expectations, forces belonging to the [[DM.Factions[faction_Ives],St. Ives Compact]] have struck at critical targets within the [[DM.Factions[faction_Liao],Capellan Confederation]], reportedly inflicting severe damage to the DropShip construction and repair facilities on Necromo and the aerospace fighter facilities on Sarna. These attacks are a clear attempt by the [[DM.Factions[faction_Ives],St. Ives Compact]] to damage the supply lines of the Capellan war machine and make the Capellansâ€™ continued prosecution of this conflict financially and logistically untenable.\r\n\n\nWould you like to know more?",

                        "Details": "Following the withdrawal of SLDF peacekeepers in late 3061, many observers predicted a swift end to the St. Ives conflict. However, SLDF forces have remained in-theater conducting unspecified training exercises, which may account for the unwillingness of Capellan commanders to commit to overwhelming force in subduing their counterparts in the [[DM.Factions[faction_Ives],St. Ives Compact]]. In addition, more than a few observers of the conflict have commented that Compact forces seem suspiciously well-equipped, prompting rumors and accusations that one or more of the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreGreatHouses],Great Houses]] are illegally funneling supplies to oppose the Capellans. Lastly, armed forces from both [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreFreeCapella],Free Capella]] and the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreCapellanMarch],Capellan March]] have recently joined those of the [[DM.Factions[faction_Ives],St. Ives Compact]], further stymieing Capellan efforts at a quick resolution.",
