[[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreTDF],TDF]] troops on Detroit apparently clashed with elements of the Colonial Marshals during a routine security sweep, resulting in the deaths of five Marshals, three [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreTDF],TDF]] soldiers, and an unknown number of civilians. Criminal elements have reportedly taken advantage of the situation, prompting widespread rioting and civil unrest.\r\n\n\nWould you like to know more?",

Since Calderon's death, [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreTDF],TDF]] troops have been deployed throughout the region hunting for suspected foreign agents implicated in the former Protector's death. Reports from the region indicate that [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreTDF],TDF]] tactics have been ineffectual and heavy-handed at best, and their presence is widely resented by the local populace.",
