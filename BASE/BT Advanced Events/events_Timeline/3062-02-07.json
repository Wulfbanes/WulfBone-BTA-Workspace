Even as Mars and Venus fell to the Blakists, many facilities and outposts within Sol System remained, at least nominally, in the hands of [[DM.Factions[faction_ComStar],ComStar]] proper. The last of these fell on 17 January, as Precentor Klaus Hettig formally joined the [[DM.Factions[faction_WordOfBlake],Word of Blake]], bringing with him the unparalleled manufacturing capabilities of the Titan Naval Yards.\r\n\n\nPlease stay tuned for a word from our sponsor.",
